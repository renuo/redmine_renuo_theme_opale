## Main features

* Left sidebar,
* Colored trackers links,
* Jira-inspired priority icons,
* Customizable with SCSS.

## Releases

* **Redmine 6.x** : use either the latest stable release ([1.6.2](https://github.com/gagnieray/opale/archive/refs/tags/1.6.2.zip)), or use the `redmine-6.x` branch of this repository.
* **Redmine 5.x** : use either the latest stable release ([1.5.1](https://github.com/gagnieray/opale/archive/refs/tags/1.5.1.zip)), or use the `redmine-5.x` branch of this repository.

## Install

To install this theme :

1. [download the lastest stable release](https://github.com/gagnieray/opale/archive/refs/tags/1.6.2.zip) and decompress the archive to your Redmine's `themes` folder,
2. rename the folder `opale-1.6.2` to `opale`,
3. go to `Redmine > Administration > Settings > Display`, select `Opale` from the theme's list and save the settings.

## Customize

If you want to customize Opale to your needs, first, make sure that you have installed [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and `npm` is available in your terminal.

Then, from the directory that contains Opale run:

```bash
npm install
```

> [!WARNING]
> In production, never include the `node_module` folder created by this command. Otherwise, if present, it could cause a timeout during assets precompilation.

Now all the dependencies should be ready to use. Run one more command:

```bash
npm run watch
```

And now the grunt is watching for changes in files placed in `src/` folder.

Just change what you need, and it'll run Sass preprocessor automatically.

Regrettably, optional file include is not possible in Sass, so I would recommend creating a new file, e.g. `src/sass/_custom-variables.scss` and importing it at the beginning of `src/sass/application.scss` using the following at-use rule : `@use "custom-variables";`.

This way all the variables defined in `src/sass/_variables.scss` with the `!default` flag could be overridden in `src/sass/_custom-variables.scss`:

```scss
@use 'variables' with (
  $sidebar-position: right,
  $brand-primary: #614ba6
);
```

The path `src/sass/_custom-variables.scss` is added to `.gitignore` so it should make upgrading Opale with keeping your changes rather painless, given that the only thing you changed in Opale's source was adding this one line `@use "custom-variables";` at the beginning of `src/sass/application.scss`.

## Troubleshooting

**On a first install, depending on your server setup, it might happen that the theme appears to be broken because the CSS were not loaded.**

This happens because assets of the theme have not been compiled properly by Redmine.

Usually simply restarting the server should fix that.

If not, run the command `bundle exec rake assets:precompile RAILS_ENV=production` on your server before restarting it.

## About Redmine Backlogs plugin

This theme also features a new look for [Redmine Backlogs](https://github.com/maedadev/redmine_backlogs) plugin.

To install it, simply copy stylesheets from `opale/plugins/redmine_backlogs` and overwrite files in `{redmine}/plugins/redmine_backlogs/assets/stylesheets`.

Then restart Redmine.
